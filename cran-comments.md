## This is the eleventh resubmission

* First resubmission after CRAN archived `gateR` on 2022-08-08 because a dependency `SpatialPack` and its dependency `fastmatrix` were archived. Since the warning from CRAN 2022-07-20, the `gateR` maintainer worked with the maintainer of both packages. The dependencies have returned to CRAN and this maintainer is now resubmitting `gateR`.

* Actions taken regarding feedback from CRAN teams' auto-check service:
  * Replaced `if()` conditions comparing `class()` to string with `inherits()`

* Updates since previous submission:
  * Updated package URL and BugReports to renamed GitHub account "lance-waller-lab" (previously "Waller-SUSAN")
  * `tools` is no longer Imports
  * `utils` is now Suggests because "zzz.R" calls the `packageDescription()` function
  * `ncdfFlow`, `flowWorkspaceData` are no longer Suggests because "Package suggested but not available for checking" in the following CRAN environments:
    * r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang
